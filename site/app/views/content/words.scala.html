            Here's some words about Database Flow, maybe a slogan or something.
          </li>
          <li class="collection-item">
            An opinionated modern database interface.
          </li>
          <li class="collection-item">
            Running locally or on a shared server, Database Flow helps you discover and search your database from a browser.
          </li>
          <li class="collection-item">
            The big advantages DBF has over it's competition:
            <ul>
              <li>- Installed locally or on a server, DBF doesn't need internet access.</li>
              <li>- Websocket-driven communications, for zero-latency and persistent connections.</li>
              <li>- Full retina support, and a Material Design implementation that scales from a phone to dual 4K monitors.</li>
              <li>- Supports the most popular half dozen databases, and adding more is easy (for me).</li>
            </ul>
